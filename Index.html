<h1> <u> The Evolution of Tennis Fashion </u> </h1> 
  <h3> Brief History of Tennis </h3>
<p> To understand the social and cultural implications of tennis dress we must first explore the history that made it what it is today. The first sight of tennis since the Renaissance of the Middle ages began in the 1870s when the once popular game of croquet had surpassed its point of popularity. In the Victorian era tennis was less seen as a sport but a leisurely activity enjoyed by elites and those who “expressed aspirations of the bourgeoisie” (Wilson, 17). This time period is where we start to see the introduction of “tennis whites” dress code in Wimbledon which was done partially to conceal to sweat but also to show the distinction between elites and the working class who could not possibly maintain the cleanliness of such a color (Allure, as cited in Shimray 2018. During this time women typically wore floor length skirts, large hats and heeled leather shoes. “In addition to the blatant class implications of tennis dress, the sport aided in progressive efforts. What made tennis so special for the time was its competitive regulations unlike many of the leisurely sports of that time and the newfound opportunity for women. Tennis arose during a time where women were fighting for equal opportunities like the right to vote and tennis provided the opportunity to play in an equal partnership to their male counterparts (Wilson, 11).  Although it wasn’t until 1884 that women were allowed to participate in esteemed tournaments like Wimbledon, they started to reimagine tennis in a more serious manner than before. Dress was just as serious as the game itself. </p>
